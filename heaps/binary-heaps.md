## NOTES

- Similar to a binary search tree, each node can have at most two children
- A heap is a tree-like data structure in which the parent is bigger than the children (max-heap), or the parent is smaller than the children (min-heap)
- The root is either the smallest value(min-heap) or the largest value(max-heap)
- No guarentee or implied ordering between siblings
- Heap is as compact as possible

## USE CASES

- used to implement priority queues
- used for graph traversals

## BIG O

- Insertion- O(1)
- Removal- O(1)
- Searching- O(n)
- Access- O(n)
