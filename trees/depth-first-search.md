## NOTES

- good for wide trees, fewer nodes to keep track of in a queue
- time complexity is the same in BFS and DFS, visiting every node once

## VARIANT USE CASES

- IN ORDER on a binary search tree, returns sorted data
- PRE ORDER can be used to export a tree structure so it can be easily reconstructed or copied
