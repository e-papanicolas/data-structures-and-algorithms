## NOTES

- consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered vertices for a directed graph
- collection of nodes and connections
- all nodes are equals, no heirarchical ordering like a tree with a root
- vertex = node, edge = connections

## USE CASES

- social networks
- location / mapping
- routing algorithms
- visual heirarchy
- file system optimizations
- recommendation algorithms

## TYPES

1. Undirected graph: there is no direction or polarity to the edges, they are two way connections
2. Directed graph: direction is represented with arrows, a one way direction is assigned to each edge
3. Unweighted graph: each edge has no value associated with it
4. Weighted graph: edges have values associated with them (think map with different distances between cities)

## BIG O

- Insertion- O()
- Removal- O()
- Access- O()
