## NOTES

- a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions
- name refers to coming up with an optimal solution

## OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS

- a problem is said to have overlapping sub-problems if it can be broken down into sub-problems which are reused several times

## OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE

- a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutionas of its sub-problems
